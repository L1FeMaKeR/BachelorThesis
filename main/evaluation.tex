\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:Evaluation}
% pages: 7.14-9.52
% Structure:
%   - Describe what the experiments wanted to show:
%       - Which environments used.
%       - What we wanted to show.
%       - What is this experiment, what we wanted to look at?
%   - Show and describe the actual results:

% Basically all of the experiments have the goal to show the value of multiple-hops in comparison to robins architecture.

%during the evaluation of the experiments, we experienced unexpected hardware issues that caused a small subset of our runs to crush. Due to time constraints we were not able to fully replicate the respective experiments. Note that we do not include these crashed runs in our evaluation, and that the resulting grid searches are thus partially incomplete. The general findings of this thesis remain unchanged.

node-wise or graph-wise value function (Optional)



\section{Dispersion}
Aggregationfunction and Rewardtype
Questions to answer:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item How do different aggregation-functions and reward-type learn easier/harder?
    \item How is this effected by num-layers? with certain aggregation-function/reward-type combinations?
\end{itemize}
Expected Answers:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item a
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Environments: Dispersion
    \item Environment: Culling Methods: more culling vs less culling, reward-type
    \item Network: latent-dimension, aggregation-function, num-blocks
\end{itemize}


\section{Pursuit}
Number of Hops: Single and Multi-Evader:
\par

(Optional) Directed vs. Undirected GNN: Single and Multi-Evader: \par
Questions to answer:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item what "learns" better or has better information propagation
\end{itemize}
Expected Answers:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Environments: Pursuit-Multi, Pursuit-Single
    \item Just add this to each of the other experiments (?)
    \item Environements: use-directed-graph.
    \item Network: num-blocks, latent-dimension, aggregation-function, neighbor-aggregation, value-function-scope
\end{itemize}
\par

(Optional) Neighbor Aggregation Type: Single and Multi-Evader \\
Questions to answer:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Agents better/worse being able to distinguish themselves from evaders for concat(aggr())?
    \item How does this effect aggregation function for aggr(aggr()). Where do I get better performance?
    \item How is the effect of more/less hopps here?
\end{itemize}
Expected Answers:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item concat(aggr()): worse iteration time, but easier to learn heterogeneous graphs.
    \item aggr(aggr()): probably mean aggregation, there are more features "preserved".
    \item num-hops: more hops should have more of an effect in concat(aggr()).
\end{itemize}
aggr(aggr()) vs concat(aggr())
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Environments: Pursuit-Single, Pursuit-Multi
    \item Environment: Base-Pursuit-Multi with 3+ Hops?
    \item Network: latent-dimension, aggregation-function, neighbor-aggregation, num-blocks
\end{itemize}

(Optional) node-wise or graph-wise value function






\section{Number of Hops}
Questions to answer:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Multi-Hops (multiple Layers) => Agents use Evader-Nodes to cache information/data.
    \item In which situations do you benefit from more layers? Show benefit of multiple layers.
    \item Effect of Multi-Hops on different levels of culling on more difficult tasks. Are they able to negate worse communication ranges? Compare policy on large communication, 1 layer vs. small communication, alot of layers. knn: num-layers: everyone can always communicate.
    \item What happens with really tight observation range?
    \item Pursuit-Multi: Strategy better then Robin? (are they able to create groups?).
    \item Describe the strategies in the different scenarios.
\end{itemize}
Expected Answers:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Harsher Culling => More Layers better. Can partially compensate. Still not the same information. Information about neighbors-neighbor still contains information about neighbor itself => it is influenced.
    \item policy on large communication, 1 layer > small communication, alot of layers. BUT may take longer?
    \item More Hops => Usually Better, but has limit. Complexer task => More Hops better (especially Pursuit-Multi).
    \item tight observation: at certain point it fails, even with alot of layers.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Environments: Rendezvous, Pursuit-Multi
    \item Environment: Culling Methods: more culling vs less culling, num-agents and dynamics?
    \item Network: num-blocks, latent-dimension, aggregation-function?
\end{itemize}


\section{node-wise or graph-wise value function}
Questions to answer:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item graph-wise: more "true" to the original Single agent RL algorithms. Should correlate better? But need to figure out themselves which agent is responsible for a reward.
    \item node-wise: better able to to gauge which agent was responsible for a given value or reward. 
\end{itemize}
Expected Answers:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Environments: Rendezvous, Pursuit-Single
    \item Just add this to each of the other experiments (?)
    \item Environements: 
    \item Network: num-blocks, latent-dimension, aggregation-function, neighbor-aggregation, value-function-scope
\end{itemize}

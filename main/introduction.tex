\chapter{Introduction}
% pages: 0.9-1.2
Applications or real-world problems that require a solution. 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item  Multi-agent: Any cooperative task. Network Systems, Biology: Ants, Bees. GNN: Deep Learning
\end{itemize} \par

Recent applications and research in MARL and GNN.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item GNN really hot right now! Alot of research in this topic.
	\item MARL: Robin Paper (this thesis is based on his!). 
	\item GNN: Graph Convolutional reinforcement learning.
\end{itemize} \par

What is GNN, What is MARL, what can GNNs it do for MARL? (the main thing we want to talk about, more conceptually)
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item MARL: Multiple Agents are trying to learn in an environment using RL Methods. Adapting RL algorithms designed for single agent environments for MAS.
	\item GNN: 
	\item What can GNN do for MARL:
\end{itemize} \par

What is my approach I want to talk about here? What was our goal?
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Approach: Based on Robin Paper => Expand on his with GNN! (this is a bachelor thesis)
	\item Goal: Show that MARL especially under harsh communication ranges can benefit alot from GNN structures with multiple hops.
\end{itemize} \par

My work relative to other work. What has other research focused on?

Stuff to talk about in introduction.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Applications or real-world problems that require a solution. 
	\item Based on Robin Paper => expand for this bachelor thesis with GNN.
	\item MARL: Good for certain applications like
	\item GNN more and more popular
	\item Using GNN for MARL
	\item What has research focused on?
	\item Some examples from research what can be done.
	\item What we set out to do what our basic goal was, that should be a natural conclusion of what we talked about above.

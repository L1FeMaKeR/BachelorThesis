pages: 2-2.68
\section{General Setup}
Talk about my code base what it is based on etc. What I use.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Optuna
    \item DAVIS
    \item Code from: Bayesian and Attentive Aggregation for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
\end{itemize} 

\section{Tasks}
Structure:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Goal.
    \item Basic Environment Structure (Torus, )
    \item Visual: example task completion, with timesteps and total environment
    \item Agent-Model (Dynamics), Evader-Model (Strategy)
    \item Reward
    \item Observation => Data, Culling and Graph
\end{itemize} 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Rendezvous
    \item Dispersion
    \item Single Evader Pursuit
    \item Multi Evader Pursuit
\end{itemize} 

\section{Experiments}
Let those experiments run over all environments where applicable.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item PPO Hacks vs No Hacks
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Environments: Rendezvous
        \item value-function-clipping (0.0 - 1.0), 1.0 = no clipping
        \item normalize rewards
        \item ?reward-clipping: graph-normalized constructor: reward-clip = 5, currently no parameter
        \item observation-normalization
        \item global gradient clipping: max-grad-norm
        \item ?tanh (insted of LeakyReLU)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Number of Hops:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Environments: Rendezvous, Pursuit-Multi
        \item Environment: Culling Methods: more culling vs less culling, num-agents and dynamics?
        \item Network: num-blocks, latent-dimension?, aggregation-function?
    \end{itemize}
    \item het-neighbor-aggregation: aggr(aggr()) vs conat(aggr())
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Environments: Pursuit-Single, Pursuit-Multi
        \item Environment: Base-Pursuit-Multi with 3+ Hops?
        \item Network: latent-dimension, aggregation-function, num-blocks
    \end{itemize}
    \item random number of agents
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Environments: Rendezvous
        \item Environment: Rendezvous: Culling Methods: more culling vs less culling
        \item Network: latent-dimension, num-blocks
    \end{itemize}
    \item random number of agents + random number of evaders
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Environments: Pursuit-Multi
        \item Environment: Multi-Pursuit: Culling Methods: more culling vs less culling
        \item Network: latent-dimension, num-blocks
    \end{itemize}
    \item dispersion: reward-type and aggregation-function
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Environments: Dispersion
        \item Environment: Culling Methods: more culling vs less culling
        \item Network: latent-dimension, aggregation-function
    \end{itemize}
    \item ?pursuit: reward-type???
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Environments: Single-Pursuit
        \item Environment: nothing?
        \item Network: latent-dimension, aggregation-function
    \end{itemize}

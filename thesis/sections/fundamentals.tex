\chapter{Fundamentals}
\label{ch:Fundamentals}

Topics:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item multiagent/multibody Systems (MAS).
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
		\item MAS Reinforcement Learning
		\item Hierarchical MAS, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for MAS.
		\item MAS with Cooperation and Competition.
		\item Problems:
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
			\item MAS Movement Problems (Potential Fields).
			\item ? using MAS for Moving a Multi-Legged Robot (Spider-like) with a navigation problem design as a hierarchical MAS?
			\item Path Planning Navigation with Heterogeneous Agents?
			\item MAS Task Problems: Rendezvous, Pursuit Evasion (Single and one Evader) (Boid?), (MAS - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robot Swarms - 2019 - KIT)
			\item Adaptive Learning for MAS?
			\item Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). Scalability for this: For fixed space they get into each others way.
			\item Collective Foraging: (Ants-kinda). Problem when communication only happens in an area, use local information exchange groups. Information Transfer. (MAS - Swarm Intelligence - 2020)
			\item Coverage: Multi-robot Information Gathering / Scouting. (MAS - Swarm Intelligence - 2020)
			\item Coalition: Heterogeneous Group of Agents. They have different skills / attrributes that affect the environment. Like an Ant Caste System? Some Agents have better sensors? Only some agents have some sensors? What if the specialization is taken to the extreme? (MAS - Swarm Intelligence - 2020). Limited Visibility Sensors (MAS - Swarm Intelligence - 2018). Going from a homogeneous group of agents, to randomized specialities, to extrem specializations. How does it change? Mixed with an Hierarchical Approach? They need to find groups to work together? Some are fast (but cannot see much, there is an insect that cannot see while running), Some have good sensors. Communication range?
			\item Collective Gradient Perception: Using Abilities of other Agents to take advantage of the whole group. (Flocking) (MAS - Swarm Intelligence - 2020)
			\item Indirect Communication through changing states in the environment (birds transport something via cable). (MAS - Swarm Intelligence - 2018)
			\item Control Architecture: Behavior Trees, FSM. (MAS - Swarm Intelligence - 2018)
			\item 
		\end{itemize}
		\item Graph-Based Visualisation for MAS. (MAS - Swarm Intelligence - 2010). How do you visualize them?

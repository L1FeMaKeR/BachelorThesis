\chapter{Project}
\label{ch:Project}

Idee:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
    \item Based on the KIT Paper "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robot Swarms".
    \item Look at Approach from a handful of papers and start adjusting what KIT did by adding to it.
    \item Add GNN instead of mean of all the agents observations use a GNN here. (Mesasge Passing)
    \item Find Problems that the KIT-Approach cannot handle well or is just able to and show how my additions lets it tackle harder tasks.
    \item Improve Scalability on the KIT-Approach (to better see the Heterogeneity?)
    \item Aspects: Direct/Indirect Communication, Control-Architecture (centralized, hybrid, self-organization), Cooperative/Competetive Environments, Global/Decentralized Communication.
    \item Given the problem a completly self-organized approach would be super interesting (no centralized critic).
    \item Tasks: Start with one simple task. Can add more later. Predator-Prey, Foraging
    \item Heterogeneity: Would be cool to have 3 cases: fully-homogeneous, (reelle zahlen (0,1))-skill-heterogeneous, binary-skill-heterogeneous (communication + one skill)
\end{itemize}

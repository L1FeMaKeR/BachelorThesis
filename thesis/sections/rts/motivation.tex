\subsection{Real-Time Strategy Games for AI}
\label{ch:Motivation:RTS4AI}
Partially Observable Environment (Fog of War), Complex interactions between Units (Micro Dynamic), Concurrent Actions, with multiple Agents on multiple scales (scale of one unit and one game participant).

Torchcraft: (insert bib link here)
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Extremely complex number of combinations (unit states, uncertainty (scouting) and volatile environment states) means that classic planning and search are not practical. 
	\item partial observable environment, hard to quantify performance standard.
	\item makes a good benchmark for AI.
\end{itemize}
A Review of Real-Time Strategy Game AI:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Video Games are an attractive alternative to robotics, as they provice a complex and realistic environment for simulations without the cost of real-world equipment and problems of practicallity.
